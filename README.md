Zoia Web Framework (Zoia.js) is based on Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB. 

The goal of Zoia is to make Web development faster and to provide the most essential functions to the developer:

* Authorization system (registration, password reset etc.)
* Captcha (using Imager which is purely written in Java)
* User management module
* Navigation menu module
* Pages management including CKEditor and built-in image browser

The system core is written in ES6 and is using modern JavaScript syntax, the client code can be optionally compiled by Babel.
